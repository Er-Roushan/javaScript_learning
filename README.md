A code repo for JavaScript learning

Welcome to my JavaScript learning repository! This repo serves as a collection of files and projects that I have created during my journey to deepen my understanding of JavaScript. It is a space where I practice coding, experiment with new concepts, and refine my skills.

**About This Repository**
This repository contains various files that I have worked on during my learning period. Each file represents a different aspect or feature of JavaScript that I have explored. From basic functions and loops to more advanced topics like asynchronous programming and DOM manipulation, you will find a wide range of examples and exercises.

**Note on Content**
I started this series after already having a basic understanding of JavaScript. As a result, some fundamental concepts may not be present in this folder. The focus here is on intermediate to advanced topics that I am currently studying and practicing. However, I believe that these examples will still be valuable to those who are looking to enhance their JavaScript skills.

**Contribution and Collaboration**
I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or improvements from the community. If you find any errors, have suggestions for new topics, or want to collaborate on a project, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!
