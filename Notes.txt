Difference between for ..in and for ..of

Key Differences:
#What they iterate over: for...of iterates over values, while for...in iterates over property keys.
#Object types: for...of works with iterable objects (arrays, strings, maps, sets, nodeList etc), while for...in works with all objects.
#Inherited properties: for...in includes inherited properties, while for...of does not.

When to use each:
#Use for...of when you want to directly access the elements of an iterable object.
#Use for...in when you want to access the keys or property names of an object.

for...of Loop:
Iterates over the values of iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.
Accesses the elements directly, not their indices or keys.

for...in Loop:
Iterates over the enumerable property keys of an object.
Accesses the names of the properties, not the values directly.
